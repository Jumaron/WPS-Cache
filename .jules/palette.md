## 2024-05-24 - Password Field UX
**Learning:** For security, password fields are often cleared on render. This confuses users who don't know if a value is saved.
**Action:** Always provide a "Password is set" indicator (text or icon) when a value exists in the database but the input is cleared. This reassures users without exposing the actual credential.
